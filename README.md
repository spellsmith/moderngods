# Welcome to Modern Gods


Modern Gods is the working title of a fictional urban-supernatural setting, 
inspired by the stories of the Cerberus Solutions roleplay group, and various
real world, literary, and original influences.  It is primarily the brainchild
of Spellsmith, and is meant primarily to be a vehicle for a text-based 
roleplay MUD and a setting for various author stories.

A partial list of (fictional) influences:

- Caballistics, Inc.  (Rebellion/2000AD)
- Hellgate: London (Flagship Studios)
- The Secret World / Secret World Legends (Funcom)
- Resident Evil (Capcom)
- The Dresden Files (Jim Butcher)
- Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Joss Whedon)
